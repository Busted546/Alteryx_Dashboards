# 📝 Description:
This project explores real estate trends across various neighborhoods in New York City, focusing on housing sales volume, average price trends, and comparative analysis between different boroughs. The dataset was prepared and analyzed using Alteryx Designer to ensure high-quality, clean, and actionable insights.

Through a series of data preparation steps—such as null value removal, duplicate filtering, conditional expressions, summarization, and sampling—the workflow standardizes raw housing data into a structured format suitable for analysis and visualization.

# 🔧 Tools Used:
- Alteryx Designer (for data preparation, cleaning, and transformation)

# ✅ Key Features:
- Cleaned and transformed NYC real estate data using Alteryx's Preparation Toolset
- Applied filters and expressions to isolate data for specific neighborhoods and time periods
- Used Formula and Summarize tools to create aggregated insights like:
  - Average sales price per neighborhood
  - Total number of transactions per borough
  - Year-over-year price comparison

Generated a dashboard (in Alteryx) showcasing key metrics with interactivity for exploring trends across different areas of the city

# 📁 Output:
The final dashboard allows users to:
- Compare real estate prices across neighborhoods
- Identify the most expensive or affordable boroughs
- Track changes in sales volume and pricing over time
