# Getting Started
Alteryx is a powerful data analytics platform that enables users to prepare, blend, and analyze data from multiple sources with minimal coding. Widely used by data analysts and business intelligence professionals, Alteryx provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and a wide array of tools for data cleaning, transformation, spatial analysis, predictive modeling, and reporting.

The Alteryx Designer tool is the core application used to build workflows, and it supports integration with popular platforms like Excel, SQL databases, Salesforce, and cloud services. It also offers advanced features like Python/R integration, machine learning, and automation through Alteryx Server and Scheduler.
